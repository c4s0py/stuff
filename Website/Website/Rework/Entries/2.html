  <center><div class="box1"><p>Stayed up a little later tonight - (You'll find that my sleep schedule is essentially non-existant) spent it working on some stuff with this website and also watching some shows from my childhood. <br><br>
  I recently started playing WOW again and good lord, everytime I get back into this game I'm so overwhelmed by all the different things to do at once. I decided to swap realms to a more populated one for both Alliance and Horde, which does mean I will have to restart my characters ( Of course i could pay to move my lvl 70 character over but I'd rather not pay.) I settled on a Undead Warrior for my Horde Realm and a Dark Elf Ranger for my Alliance Realm, Arms and BM respectively.<br><br>
  I also started replaying Red Dead Redemption 2, I think this will be my 4th or 5th playthough? But my first real one on my PC, prior to that I usually just played it on my Playstation, which by the way I was just reminded on how god awful those controllers are, don't get me wrong the design and feel is great but the quality is terrible. I've brought three controllers and all three of them have suffered from stick-drift in some way. Now the first two could just be chalked up to extended usage which admittedly I did have them for a while, but the third one I had for not even a week prior to it starting to drift. Used an Xbox Controller and I haven't had a problem since. <br><br>
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
