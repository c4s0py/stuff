  <center><div class="box1"><p>These last few days have been... difficult? It feels like these last few months have just been one long, continuous day. Don't get me wrong, I do sleep and rest (provided you can call it that.), but every day kind of just morphs into another with no real sense of direction. Overall, I'm still taking every day as it comes and just trying to stay positive, but some days are harder than others. Ultimately, you just have to keep going becauseâ€”what other options do you have? <br><br>

In some much brighter news, In a few days, everyone will be leaving for a while, leaving just me and my mother here, which ultimately should prove to be a relaxing experience, and I'm quite excited for the tranquilly and solitude. I think the best way to describe it when everyone is here is that it's kind of like the house from home alone. You know, the entire family is around the night before they leave for vacation, and everything is just happening all at once. It's extremely overwhelming. I'm pretty sure once everyone leaves, we are going to be doing an entire deep cleaning of the house, which I'm actually a little excited for. When you live with what feels like barbarians, you find enjoyment in the little things. But more so than just cleaning the house, I think just us two being here is going to be nice and allow us to bond after everything that's happened these last few months. <br><br>

I think we'll also be taking the dog out, which, surprising enough, actually makes for a pretty fun dog to take out. At least with our previous dogs, it was extremely frustrating to do so because you'd let them off, and they would be gone. They almost think it's a game, which is annoying, but we do eventually catch them in the end. But with the new dog, he actually listens. I think my father would have been proud of how much he's learned, especially when you take into account his previous owners. <br><br>
