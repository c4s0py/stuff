  <center><div class="box6"><p> Hey friends, It's been a while hasn't it? 2 months according to neocities. Yeah, uh- Life is still relatively the same. I have easier days and harder days and it's all a slight struggle, I'm trying to get a sense of normality and routine after what happened, it's going to be a long journey but who knows, maybe it'll work. In other news Cage The Elephant released a new album not even 1 week ago and I must say, it is pretty damn good - Maybe even better than social cues, I think some of my favourite songs right now are Metaverse, Silent Picture, Good Time and Out Loud. It's a little funny actually because I've heard alot of people talk about how Neon Pill is pretty mediocre when compared to the rest of the songs but honestly, I really liked Neon Pill - it was really good.<br><br> I also recently started playing  TTW ( Tale of two wastelands ), It's a mod that combines Fallout 3 & New Vegas into one big game and It's alright. I enjoy it, I played through 3 and then moved to new vegas but didn't finish New Vegas. I don't know, I love it but maybe it's some type of autisim thing but I just really prefer playing them as seperate games, not because it's too much but because I enjoy the seperate feelings each game gives me? It sounds a little crazy I know but whatever, to be fair I fucked up my vegas save anyway when I used TMM 1 to try and find where the hell fawks vanished to and my previous saves still had TMM 1, which to most of you isnt that big of a deal but I dislike cheating and / or using console commands in games - ruins the playthrough imo. anyway, enough of my yapping about fallout <br><br> I am trying to do this new thing where every day I will try and learn something new - I've always enjoyed the prospect of always learning, to never ever stop learning and I guess  I've taken that further by this. Everything new & interesting I learn I write it down in my notebook as a reminder of said thing I learned, for example yesterday I learned about Operation RÃ¶sselsprung, which was an attempt at assassinating the Yugoslav Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito which ultimately failed not only because of resisitance within the town but also because of incompetence on not only the german inteligence's part but also the lack of planning by the commander of the german airforce.
